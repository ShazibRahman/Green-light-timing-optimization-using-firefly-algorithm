# Project Title - optimization of green signal timings of traffic light controllers using firefly algorithms
<br>



## Abstract
Traffic lights are source of signalling device for road junctions. Traffic light controllers are programmed to assign timely directions to road users in Red, Yellow and Green. Present Traffic Light Controllers are based on microcontroller.TLC have limitations as it uses pre-defined hardware, which functions according to program that does not have flexibility of modification on real time basis. As the numbers of road users’ increases, resources provided by current infrastructures are limited, thus control of traffic becomes very important. To mange traffic flow, introduction of new technique ‘Dynamic Traffic Signal Controller’ emerged. Thus, optimization of traffic light switching; controls road capacity traffic flow and prevent congestions. The unique aspect is that web application is provided over mobile phones to road users who wish to access the traffic management application for traffic news. The application displays the traffic status. The proposed system has simple architecture, ease of implementation and user friendliness.

## 1.Introduction
Presently, modern lifestyle consists of fast and rapid transport mediums which play a vital role in economic development for any nation. All developed nations have well developed transportations system with efficient traffic control on road, rail and air. Transportation of goods, industrial products, manpower and machinery are the key factors which influence the industrial development of any country. Also, the drastic/rigorous changing condition of road traffic is rising as a serious problem for people to move, infrastructure wise and as nation’s economic point of view. Hence traffic congestion leads to long waiting hours along with fuel and money wastage. So, the Traffic management on road is crucial to reduce these problems. Now, control and management of city traffic has become a major problem in many countries even though Regional Traffic Office has found solutions to overcome these traffic issues. One way to improve traffic flow and safety of current transport system is to apply automation and intelligent control methods to road infrastructure . Also, measures like new roads, flyovers, ring roads, city trains are applicable for traffic management. But as the number of road users increase and resources provide by current infrastructures are limited dynamic control of traffic is need of hour.

## Traffic Jams Everywhere
Under ordinary conditions when the traffic lanewaits for the green light, time setting is same and fixed.With increasing number of vehicles on roads has  substantially increases congestion. This is observedusually at main junctions in morning, office hours andafter office hours. Hence the main effect of this increases the waiting time of people on road. Thus a solution for this matter can be given by different delays to traffic lanes which is called as normal mode operation.

## Have To Wait , Even Where Is No Traffic
At certain junctions even if there is no traffic when the traffic light remains red the road users have to wait until the light turns green. And if rule is broken fine has to be paid .The solution of this problem is by developing the system which detects traffic density on each road and then sets signal timing accordingly along with synchronization of the adjacent junction’s traffic signal.

## During Emergency
During traffic jam an emergency vehicle like ambulance, fire brigade, police are stuck and have to wait for the traffic light to turn green. Hence this critical problem may further complicate that costs human life. So solution to this problem can be given by having priority for emergency vehicle to flow rapidly through the traffic while other vehicles are instructed to be still (i.e. traffic signal light is red).

## Limited Traffic Information To Drivers
Present conventional traffic system fails to provide traffic status about congested roads,alternate routes etc. A remedy for this issue is to design a user web application to road users who shall access the URL of he web application.

The dynamic traffic signal controller is introduced in this project with efficient functions and hardware interface. The traffic jam will be reduced by increasing green signal time for busy lanes and decreasing red signal time for non busy roads. In other words dynamic signal switching can be achieved by when vehicle density of the four way junction road is known. Secondly, traffic news is provided through the website design for users ease. Therefore, improvement of town traffic condition is largely dependent on the modern ways of traffic management and control. Advanced traffic signal controllers and control system contribute to the improvement of the traffic problem.

## 2. Survey
Nowadays, vehicles on road are increasing each day like growing cities of this world. Traffic Management on road has become the need of hour in today’s urban lifestyle. Efficient techniques are needed to reduce travel time, usage of money, fuel and waiting hours along with gamut of other problems too. Thus need arises for simulating and optimizing current system for the traffic controllers to better accommodate this increasing demand by road users around the world.Traffic lights are commonly used devices to regulate roadway intersection traffic with a view to both safety and smoothness of vehicle flow, for generations where it is still considered the best practices . Various methods and approaches are suggested in literature for solving the traffic control problem. It includes rule based learning to the modern fuzzy and neural network approaches. In this section, the various solutions to the traffic control problems suggested in the literature are discussed, along with their merits and demerits.

Since the traffic light was invented ages ago, there have been significant revolutions lined down in various aspects about same. The most common revelation which we can visualize is the displays of traffic light itself. The other revolution which is being enhanced and improved is the traffic light controllers

## 4. Conclusion
The optimization of city traffic scenario is an important issue to be considered. Hence modern techniques of traffic management contribute to optimization of traffic problem. The dynamic traffic signal controller is introduced in this project having specific functions along with hardware interface. The first part is designing of program which consists of data collection, sorting, calculation of percentage and therefore automatic evaluation of signal time. After that the second part is web application which is designed to provide
traffic alerts for road users and take measures to avoid congestion. So problems such as wastage of fuel, emergency case could be overcome through this proposed system. This system aims at saving a large amount of waiting hours caused by traffic deadlocks, where control can save time and property.
