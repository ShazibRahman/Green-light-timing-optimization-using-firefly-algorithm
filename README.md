Traffic lights are source of signalling device for road junctions. Traffic light controllers are programmed to assign timely directions to road users in Red, Yellow and Green. Present Traffic Light Controllers are based on microcontroller.TLC have limitations as it uses pre-defined hardware, which functions according to program that does not have flexibility of modification on real time basis. As the numbers of road users’ increases, resources provided by current infrastructures are limited, thus control of traffic becomes very important. To mange traffic flow, introduction of new technique ‘Dynamic Traffic Signal Controller’ emerged. Thus, optimization of traffic light switching; controls road capacity traffic flow and prevent congestions. The unique aspect is that web application is provided over mobile phones to road users who wish to access the traffic management application for traffic news. The application displays the traffic status. The proposed system has simple architecture, ease of implementation and user friendliness.

## 1.Introduction
Presently, modern lifestyle consists of fast and rapid transport mediums which play a vital role in economic development for any nation. All developed nations have well developed transportations system with efficient traffic control on road, rail and air. Transportation of goods, industrial products, manpower and machinery are the key factors which influence the industrial development of any country. Also, the drastic/rigorous changing condition of road traffic is rising as a serious problem for people to move, infrastructure wise and as nation’s economic point of view. Hence traffic congestion leads to long waiting hours along with fuel and money wastage. So, the Traffic management on road is crucial to reduce these problems. Now, control and management of city traffic has become a major problem in many countries even though Regional Traffic Office has found solutions to overcome these traffic issues. One way to improve traffic flow and safety of current transport system is to apply automation and intelligent control methods to road infrastructure . Also, measures like new roads, flyovers, ring roads, city trains are applicable for traffic management. But as the number of road users increase and resources provide by current infrastructures are limited dynamic control of traffic is need of hour.

## Traffic Jams Everywhere
Under ordinary conditions when the traffic lanewaits for the green light, time setting is same and fixed.With increasing number of vehicles on roads has  substantially increases congestion. This is observedusually at main junctions in morning, office hours andafter office hours. Hence the main effect of this increases the waiting time of people on road. Thus a solution for this matter can be given by different delays to traffic lanes which is called as normal mode operation.

## Need To Wait , Even Where Is No Traffic
At certain junctions even if there is no traffic when the traffic light remains red the road users have to wait until the light turns green. And if rule is broken fine has to be paid .The solution of this problem is by developing the system which detects traffic density on each road and then sets signal timing accordingly along with synchronization of the adjacent junction’s traffic signal.

## During Emergency
During traffic jam an emergency vehicle like ambulance, fire brigade, police are stuck and have to wait for the traffic light to turn green. Hence this critical problem may further complicate that costs human life. So solution to this problem can be given by having priority for emergency vehicle to flow rapidly through the traffic while other vehicles are instructed to be still (i.e. traffic signal light is red).
